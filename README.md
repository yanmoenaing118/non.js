## Work in Progress

non.js is a HTML5 Canvas 2D game engine.
This project is based on the book (<strong><i>HTML5 Games: Novice to Ninja by Earle Castledine</i></strong>) that I am currently reading.


```js
Game Loop ->
 (1) Fetch user input
 (2) Update Everything based on Input
 (3) Rerender Everything based on Updated data
